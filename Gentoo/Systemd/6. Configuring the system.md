# [Configuring the system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/System)
## Filesystem information
### Fstab file
You can use `blkid` to check you partitions and the thei file formats.
```bash
root $ blkid
```
Edit `/etc/fstab` to include all of your partitions.  
Example:
```bash
/dev/nvme0n1p1  /boot vfat  defaults  0 2
/dev/nvme0n1p2  none  swap  sw        0 0
/dev/nvme0n1p3  /     ext4  noatime   0 1
```
### The host file
```bash
root $ nano /etc/hosts
```
```bash
/etc/hosts
# This defines the current system and must be set
127.0.0.1     tux.homenetwork tux localhost
  
# Optional definition of extra systems on the network
192.168.0.5   jenny.homenetwork jenny
192.168.0.6   benny.homenetwork benny
```
Also create file `/etc/hostnames` and add your hostname there.  
### Machine ID
Create a machine ID for journaling to work. This can be done through the following command:  
```bash
root $ systemd-machine-id-setup
```
### Network
`systemd-networkd` is useful for simple configuration of wired network interfaces. It is disabled by default.  
To configure systemd-networkd, create a .network file under `/etc/systemd/network`.  
A simple DHCP configuration is given below:
```bash
/etc/systemd/network/50-dhcp.network
[Match]
Name=en*
 
[Network]
DHCP=yes
```
Enable `systemd-network` to launh when system is turned on.
```bash
root $ systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
```
### Preset service
Most services are disabled when systemd is first installed.  
A "preset" file is provided, and may be used to enable a reasonable set of default services.
```bash
root $ systemctl preset-all
```
## System information
### Root password
Set the root password using the `passwd` command.
```bash
root $ passwd
```
