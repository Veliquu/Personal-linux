## Adding user for daily use
The groups the user is member of define what activities the user can perform. The following table lists a number of important groups:  
|Group	  |Description                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|audio	  |Be able to access the audio devices.                                       |
|cdrom	  |Be able to directly access optical devices.                                |
|floppy	  |Be able to directly access floppy devices.                                 |
|games	  |Be able to play games.                                                     |
|portage	|Be able to access portage restricted resources.                            |
|usb	    |Be able to access USB devices.                                             |
|video	  |Be able to access video capturing hardware and doing hardware acceleration.|
|wheel	  |Be able to use su.                                                         |

For instance, to create a user called `larry` who is member of the wheel, users, and audio groups, log in as root first (only root can create users) and run useradd:
```bash
Login: root
Password: (Enter the root password)
```
```bash
root $ useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio -s /bin/bash larry
root $ passwd larry
Password: (Enter the password for larry)
Re-enter password: (Re-enter the password to verify)
```
## Removing tarballs
```bash
root $ rm /stage3-*.tar.*
```
## Going forward
System is now installed.  
You may want to instal yourself desktop enviroment or build one yourself.
