# [Configuring the system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/System)
## Filesystem information
### Fstab file
You can use `blkid` to check you partitions and the thei file formats.
```bash
root $ blkid
```
Edit `/etc/fstab` to include all of your partitions.  
Example:
```bash
/dev/nvme0n1p1  /boot vfat  defaults  0 2
/dev/nvme0n1p2  none  swap  sw        0 0
/dev/nvme0n1p3  /     ext4  noatime   0 1
```
### The host file
```bash
root $ nano /etc/hosts
```
```bash
/etc/hosts
# This defines the current system and must be set
127.0.0.1     tux.homenetwork tux localhost
  
# Optional definition of extra systems on the network
192.168.0.5   jenny.homenetwork jenny
192.168.0.6   benny.homenetwork benny
```

### Machine ID
Create a machine ID for journaling to work. This can be done through the following command:  
```bash
root $ systemd-machine-id-setup
```
### Network
I will be installin NetworkManager as it makes it easier for me in later states when I'm building my desktop enviroment.
```bash
root $ emerge --ask net-misc/networkmanager
```
Enable `NetworkManager` to launh when system is turned on.
```bash
root $ systemctl enable NetwokManager
```

## System information
### Root password
Set the root password using the `passwd` command.
```bash
root $ passwd
```
### Init and boot configuration
Most services are disabled when systemd is first installed.  
First, it is recommended to run systemd-firstboot which will prepare various components of the system are set correctly for the first boot into the new systemd environment.
```bash
root $ systemd-firstboot --prompt --setup-machine-id
```
A "preset" file is provided, and may be used to enable a reasonable set of default services.
```bash
root $ systemctl preset-all --preset-mode=enable-only
```
