# [Configuring the bootloader](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Bootloader)
## GRUB
When using UEFI, users will need to ensure `GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"` is enabled (as it is the case by default).  
 If that is not the case for the setup, `GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"` will need to be added to the `/etc/portage/make.conf` file before emerging GRUB so that the package will be built with EFI functionality:
```bash
root $ echo 'GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```
```bash
root $ emerge --ask sys-boot/grub
```
If GRUB was somehow emerged without enabling `GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"`, the line (as shown above) can be added to `make.conf` and then dependencies for the world package set can be re-calculated by passing the `--update` `--newuse` options to `emerge`:
```bash
root $ emerge --ask --update --newuse --verbose sys-boot/grub
```
The GRUB software has now been merged to the system, but not yet installed.
### Install
Next, install the necessary GRUB files to the `/boot/grub/` directory via the `grub-install` command.  
When using UEFI: 
```bash
root $ grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --removable
```
### Configure
Next, generate the GRUB configuration based on the user configuration specified in the `/etc/default/grub` file and `/etc/grub.d` scripts.
```bash
root $ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
If you get following message:
```bash
Warning: os-prober will not be executed to detect other bootable partitions.
```
To fix this, install `sys-boot/os-prober`:
```bash
root $ emerge -ask sys-boot/os-prober
```
Then add the following line to `/etc/default/grub`
```bash
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```
Then run the configuration command again:
```bash
root $ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
## Rebooting the system
Exit the chrooted environment and unmount all mounted partitions.  
Then type in that one magical command that initiates the final, true test: reboot.
```bash
root $ exit
```
```bash
cdimage ~$ cd
cdimage ~$ umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}
cdimage ~$ umount -R /mnt/gentoo
cdimage ~$ reboot
```
