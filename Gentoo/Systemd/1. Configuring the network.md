# [Configuring the network](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Networking)
Use either `ifconfig` or `ip addr` command to determine your network interface.  
  
Tets the network:
```bash
root # ping -c 3 www.gentoo.org
```
## Automatic network configuration
If the ping doesn't work or you are using wifi, you need to configurate the network.  
  
### Default: Using net-setup
Easy way to configurate automaticly is to run the `net-setup` script:
```bash
root # net-setup wlp2s0
```
* You would change `wlp2s0` to the network interface that you have.  
  
After that you test the network as previously mentioned.  
* Sometimes I need to run `net-setup` twice for it to work.  

### Using DHCP
DHCP makes it possible to automatically receive networking information.  
To have a network interface receive this information automatically, use `dhcpcd`:
```bash
root # dhcpcd wlp2s0
```
